The real important part to remember here is the ratio of egg to cheese. You can use ham as a substitute for pancetta/guanciale in a pinch, and the plate should realistically take 20 mins to make.

# Ingredients 
Per person:
* 1 Egg
* 50g of Pecorino Romano (Parmesan works in a pinch) 
* 75g of Pasta. Can just eyeball this to a portion. ([bronze cut pasta would be the best option here!](https://www.epicurious.com/ingredients/what-is-bronze-cut-pasta-and-is-it-worth-it-article))
* 1/2tsp of Salt
* 1tsp of Pepper
* 50g of Guanciale/Pancetta/Ham

# Steps
1. **Put water to boil, salt heavily.** Ideally you would try to use the least amount of water possible to get a higher concentration of starch in it.
2. **Cut guanciale into 1/2 inch cubes and start frying until crispy and then leaving to rest.**
3. **Once water has rolling boil, put pasta in.** Aiming for al dente. You want to keep the water as hot as possible, as this is where the heat to cook the sauce will come from.
4. **In a bowl, mix grated cheese, eggs and pepper.** Should have the consistency halfway between a paste and a sauce.
5. **Remove around 1/2 the amount of oil in the pan with the guanciale.** We do this to prevent the pasta sauce becoming oily.
6. **Add around 2 table spoons worth of pasta water to sauce mixture.** Mix well. This is the key to stop sauce from curdling.
7. **Once the pasta is ready, reserve a cup of pasta water, and drain.**
8. **As quick as possible throw pasta into pan with guanciale and pour sauce over it.** We are aiming to lose as little heat as possible.
9. **Keep on mixing till thick sauce forms.** Important to not stop mixing or sauce could curdle. 
10. **If thick sauce never forms, heat pan on low and keep mixing** (make sure to get the bottom bits!) until thick sauce forms.
11. **Serve with more pecorino on top and freshly ground pepper.**
