> **TL;DR** Getting into Leetcode can be daunting. You can be really good at being an engineer, but still have no idea where to start being *good* at leetcoding. Working your way back from patterns can be a really good place to start if you have no idea what you're doing, as it forces you to understand patterns that you can later use in other solutions. A good way of doing this is going onto Leetcoding courses to see which patterns are relevant, and then finding problems that you can utilise these patterns. 

# The problem

So you've decided to take a step into interviewing for a new job, and you've read online that big tech _really_ likes leetcoding problems. Leetcoding? That should be simple enough, they're just puzzles disguised as coding problems and you know you're good with logical puzzles.

You jump on to [Leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/), successfully solved a few problems and now face the scary statistic that your solution is on the 5th percentile in terms of execution time and memory usage. Great.

# How to get a better score (and therefore more interviews)

Patterns, patterns, patterns. All of this is just one giant test for seeing if you can memorise algorithms to make your solutions fast. Unless you are super fresh out of a computer science degree, and have lots of experience in doing problems like these (don't think you'd be on here if you did), then it's more than likely that you have no idea what an optional solution looks like. Sure, you can browse for the solutions and read a bunch of intentionally minimal code... or you could just reverse your method of learning. 

It might seem obvious, but starting from the patterns and then working your way through the problems will give you a much better starting point. You'll immediately be able to start creating more optimal solutions, and building a strong foundation than blindly solving problems.

# Cool, so how do I do that?

The inspiration for this post came from [this post on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sgktuv/the_definitive_way_on_how_to_leetcode_properly/). I don't agree with all of it, as it mentions things like starting by just reading solutions without going through the trouble of coding it. I think that the coding part gives a lot of insight into your mindset when solving problems, so I just ignored that.

What it does give good advice on is which websites to be able to work off from. For example, the [Grokking coding interview course](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-coding-interview-patterns-javascript) gives a nice course outline on which patterns are still relevant in modern leetcoding exercises. From here, we can reverse search for problems that apply these patterns in [Leetcode's problemsets](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all).

You might find that after a while this might not suit you, and start developing your own way of getting better at it. But as a starting point, this defintely ensures that you'll get better the more patterns you learn.
