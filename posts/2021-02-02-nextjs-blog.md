> **TL;DR** *Svelte offers better performance compared with React, with the same component-based UI tooling.*

# Why I used Next.js

I recently started working in web, and had limited experience programming for the web. From my university projects, I found JQuery and raw HTML and CSS very rudimentary,so when I was introduced to React, I was pleasantly shocked at how much I enjoyed the developer experience.

Looking around for the tech-stack I wanted to build my blog on, I stumbled across [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Next.js was a React framework that handled a lot of configuration and tooling, doing stuff like server-side rendering and routing for you.
