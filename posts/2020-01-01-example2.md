# What I learnt building a blog with Next.js

This blog was an attempt to take a product from a design phase, and implement that on my own.
I enjoy the process of mocking out designs and seeing them raise from nothing, like a frankenstein but 100x less impressive.
Here's a little on what I've learnt on the process, my experience using Next.js, and what I would do if I had to do it again.

```js
const example = () => {
   console.log('some wise ideas go here >>');
}
```
