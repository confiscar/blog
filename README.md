# Fran's Blog

This is all the code to my blog. Posts are generated from markdown. `/blog` contains the blog posts and `/recipes` contain all my recipes.
If anything seems wrong in my posts, feel free to open an issue or a PR about it.

Built with `next.js` and `react`.

## Running the project

* `npm run dev` for development server @ [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* `npm run build` to build bundle
* `npm run lint` to lint
